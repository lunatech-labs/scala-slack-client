# scala-slack-client

An asynchronous Scala library to interact with the Slack [API](https://api.slack.com) as of June 2018.

[ ![Codeship Status for lunatech-labs/scala-slack-client](https://app.codeship.com/projects/0a9404a0-5ce4-0136-2cc1-460bed3baf8d/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/295784)

## Installation

Add this dependency in your build.sbt

```
libraryDependencies += "com.lunatech" % "scala-slack-client" % "0.2.3"
```

## How to Use

* Create an app with slack [here](https://api.slack.com/apps).
* Add permissions to your bot by going to *OAuth & Permissions* tab
To run the Hello world code below add **chat:write:bot** in permissions scope.
* Go to *Install App* tab and install your bot to your workspace.
* Copy the **OAuth Access Token** access token, you will need it in your app to control the bot.
* Put the code below in your scala project and your bot should send an *"Hello, world!"* in your channel **#General**

```scala
val slackClient = SlackClient(<Bot token>)
slackClient.postMessage(ChatMessage("#general", "Hello, Wold!"))
```

To process the response of your bot features you can use our Parser.  

SlashCommands :  
```
Parser.slashCommand(body: Map[String, Seq[String]]): Try[SlashCommandPayload]
```
Interactive Components : 
```
Parser.getPayload(body: Map[String, Seq[String]]): Try[Payload]
```

## Examples

### Sending a message

A slack bot can send two type of message : In channel and Ephemeral.  
An ephemeral message can only be viewed by one User.

Our library uses [postMessage](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) and [postEphemeral](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postEphemeral) to send messages.

We provide builders to make your message easier to write.

If you want to write a message with buttons you can write it like this. (See [slack documention](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) for more information)

```scala
val message = ChatMessage(channel = "#general", text = "this is a message with ChatMessage")
      .addAttachment(AttachmentField(fallback = "update your API", callback_id = "buttons")
        .addAction(Button(name = "PrimaryButton", text = "Primary button").asPrimaryButton))
        .addAction(Button(name = "DefaultButton", text = "Default button"))
        .addAction(Button(name = "DangerButton", text = "DangerButton").asDangerButton.withConfirmation("Are you sure"))
        .withPretext("Click one of these button")
      )

slackClient.postMessage(message)
```
All methods can be used the same way.
